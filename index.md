### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part two of this lab was one of my favorites as I am aware of the game of blackjack and thought this lab to be fun. I found lots of difficulties creating the lines of code needed to assign a value to each card and face.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a personal favorite of mine because of how challenging it was for me to really understand how to write the functions needed to fit what was being asked. In this lab we  were given parking signs that included days of the week and times, with what was given it was our job to create functions that would check whether street parking was allowed or not according to the signs. Although the lab was tough this really cemented if statements for me.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part two involved the creation of a game. The game in this case involved us making two programs, one that one person would hide a number for the other to guess, while the other program would be used for the guessing of the number. This was fun and allowed for my partner and I to really try and work together to configure the game to work.
